# CBIR
Content Based Image Retrieval System

The CBIR system takes in a query image of any animal (trained on animal dataset) and returns various animal image matches of the same animal

- We have implemented three different image matching algorithms based on RGB histograms, Edge Detection, and VGG16 mode (CNNs)
